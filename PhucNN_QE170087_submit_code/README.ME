## 📌 **Project Overview**
This project explores the **2D Cutting Stock Problem** (CSP) using heuristic algorithms, specifically the **First-Fit** and **Best-Fit** strategies. The aim is to minimize material waste while meeting demand requirements for specific cut pieces. These heuristic approaches provide a balance between computational efficiency and solution quality, making them practical for real-world applications.

## 🔎 **Problem Description**
- **Objective:** Efficiently cut smaller pieces from larger stock sheets while minimizing waste.
- **Constraints:**  
  - No overlapping between cut pieces.  
  - Pieces must remain within the boundaries of the stock sheet.  
  - Fulfill all quantity demands for each piece type.  

---

## 💡 **Approach**
The solution applies a combination of heuristic algorithms to optimize the placement of pieces:

1. **First-Fit (FF):**  
   - Places each piece in the first available position of the stock sheets.  
   - Simple and fast, but may lead to higher waste.

2. **Best-Fit (BF):**  
   - If FF fails, it searches for the position that minimizes unused space on the stock sheets.  
   - Improves material utilization but requires more computational effort.

3. **Opening New Stock:**  
   - If no suitable position is found, a new stock sheet is opened to accommodate the remaining pieces.

## 📊 **Benchmark - Combination Heuristic Evaluation**
This benchmark evaluates the performance of the combination heuristic approach using the following metrics:
- **Waste Rate:** Ratio of unused area to total required area.
- **Fitness:** Ratio of required area to the total utilized stock area.
- **Runtime:** Time taken to complete the cutting process.

| Order ID | Stock Count | Waste Rate | Fitness | Runtime (s) |
|----------|-------------|------------|---------|-------------|
| Order 001 | 2           | 0.25       | 0.80    | 0.12        |
| Order 002 | 3           | 0.30       | 0.77    | 0.15        |
| Order 003 | 3           | 0.22       | 0.82    | 0.14        |
| Order 004 | 4           | 0.28       | 0.79    | 0.18        |

*Note: The results are based on sample orders with predefined piece sizes and quantities.*
