# 🪵 Wood Cutting in Furniture Industry - Capstone Assignment (REL301M)

## ✂️ Group 2 - Cutting Stock Problem 2D

### 📌 Overview

This repository contains the capstone project for the course **Reinforcement Learning (REL301M)**. Our project focuses on solving the **2D Cutting Stock Problem (CSP)** in the **furniture industry**, optimizing wood cutting to minimize waste and maximize efficiency using heuristic and reinforcement learning approaches.

### 🏗️ Problem Statement

The **2D Cutting Stock Problem** involves cutting rectangular demand pieces from larger wooden stock sheets while minimizing waste. This problem has significant applications in industries like furniture manufacturing, where efficient material utilization directly impacts costs and sustainability.

### ⚙️ Approach

We have implemented various algorithms to tackle this problem, including:

- ✅ **First Fit Algorithm**: Places each demand piece in the first available position on a stock sheet.
- 🏆 **Best Fit Algorithm**: Chooses the best possible position based on remaining space.
- 🤖 **Reinforcement Learning-based Approach**: Uses RL techniques to optimize cutting strategies over time.
